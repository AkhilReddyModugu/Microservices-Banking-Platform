# BankFlow — Banking Microservices Platform

A production-style distributed banking system built with Spring Boot microservices.
Supports customer onboarding, account management, fund transfers, and real-time
email notifications using asynchronous event-driven communication.

## Architecture

```
Client
└── API Gateway (port 8080)
    ├── Customer Service     (port 8002)
    ├── Account Service      (port 8001)
    ├── Transaction Service  (port 8003)
    └── Notification Service (port 8004)

Service Discovery : Eureka Server (port 8761)
Messaging         : RabbitMQ
Database          : MySQL (separate DB per service)
```

Each service is independently deployable with its own database.
Services communicate via **OpenFeign** (synchronous) and **RabbitMQ** (asynchronous).

---

## Services

### Eureka Server — Port 8761

Service registry. Every other service registers here on startup.
API Gateway and Feign clients look up service addresses dynamically — no hardcoded URLs.

---

### API Gateway — Port 8080

Single entry point for all client requests. Routes traffic based on path:

| Path | Routed To |
|---|---|
| `/customers/**` | Customer Service |
| `/accounts/**` | Account Service |
| `/transactions/**` | Transaction Service |
| `/notifications/**` | Notification Service |

Uses `lb://` (load-balanced) routing via Eureka.

---

### Customer Service — Port 8002

Manages customer profiles.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/customers` | Get all customers |
| GET | `/customers/{id}` | Get customer by ID |
| POST | `/customers` | Create new customer |
| DELETE | `/customers/{id}` | Delete customer |

- **On create:** publishes a welcome notification event to RabbitMQ.
- **On delete:** calls Account Service via Feign to delete the associated account, then publishes a deletion notification.

---

### Account Service — Port 8001

Manages bank accounts.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/accounts` | Get all accounts |
| GET | `/accounts/{id}` | Get account by ID |
| GET | `/accounts/customer/{id}` | Get account by customer ID |
| GET | `/accounts/account/{accountNumber}` | Get account by account number |
| POST | `/accounts` | Create new account |
| PUT | `/accounts/update` | Update account balance |
| DELETE | `/accounts/{accountNumber}` | Delete account |

- **On create/delete:** calls Customer Service via Feign to get customer details, then publishes a notification event to RabbitMQ.

---

### Transaction Service — Port 8003

Handles all financial operations.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/transactions` | Get all transactions |
| GET | `/transactions/account/{accountNumber}` | Get by account number |
| GET | `/transactions/transaction/{type}` | Get by type (`CREDIT` / `DEBIT`) |
| POST | `/transactions/credit-transfer` | Credit an account |
| POST | `/transactions/debit-transfer` | Debit an account |
| POST | `/transactions/transfer` | Transfer between two accounts |

**Business rules enforced:**
- Debit and transfer are rejected if balance is insufficient.
- Transfer is rejected if sender and receiver are the same account.
- Transfer enforces a minimum amount of ₹10.
- Every transaction publishes a notification event to RabbitMQ.

---

### Notification Service — Port 8004

Listens to RabbitMQ and sends emails.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/notifications/send` | Send notification directly (sync) |

- Consumes messages from the RabbitMQ queue automatically.
- Validates email format before sending.
- Saves every notification to its own database for audit.
- Uses `JavaMailSender` with SMTP (configurable — Gmail, SendGrid, etc.).

## How Communication Works

### Synchronous (OpenFeign)

Used when a service needs data from another service immediately.

**Example:** When creating an account, Account Service needs the customer's
email to send a welcome notification. It calls Customer Service via Feign:

```
Account Service ──Feign──▶ Customer Service
                           returns CustomerDTO (name, email)
```

### Asynchronous (RabbitMQ)

Used for notifications — fire and forget. The calling service does not wait for the email to be sent.

```
Account Service ──publishes──▶ RabbitMQ Exchange
                                      │
                               routes via binding key
                                      │
                               Notification Queue
                                      │
                          Notification Service consumes
                                      │
                          JavaMailSender sends email
```

> If Notification Service is down, messages stay in the queue and are delivered automatically when it restarts. No notification is lost.

```

---

## Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Maven 3.8+
- MySQL 8
- RabbitMQ (running locally on default port `5672`)

---

## Database Setup

Create these databases in MySQL before starting the services:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE customers_db;
CREATE DATABASE accounts_db;
CREATE DATABASE transaction_db;
CREATE DATABASE notification_db;
```

Tables are created automatically by Hibernate on first startup (`ddl-auto: update`).

---

## Configuration

Each service has its own `application.yml`. Update the following before running:

**Database** (all services except Eureka and Gateway):

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    username: your_mysql_username
    password: your_mysql_password
```

**Email** (Notification Service):

```yaml
spring:
  mail:
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    username: your_email@gmail.com
    password: your_app_password
    properties:
      mail:
        smtp:
          auth: true
          starttls:
            enable: true
```

> For Gmail, generate an **App Password** from your Google account settings (requires 2FA to be enabled).

---

## Running the Project

Start services **in this order** — each depends on the one before it:

**1. Eureka Server**
```bash
cd Eureka-server
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Verify: http://localhost:8761

**2. API Gateway**
```bash
cd Api-gateway
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**3. Customer Service**
```bash
cd CoustomerServices
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**4. Account Service**
```bash
cd Accountservices
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**5. Transaction Service**
```bash
cd TransactionService
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**6. Notification Service**
```bash
cd Notification-Service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

After all services start, they will all appear registered at: http://localhost:8761

All requests go through the gateway at **http://localhost:8080**

---

## Sample API Calls

All requests go to port `8080` (gateway). Use Postman or curl.

**Create a customer**
```http
POST http://localhost:8080/customers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstName": "Akhil",
  "lastName": "Reddy",
  "gender": "Male",
  "address": "Hyderabad",
  "phoneNumber": "9999999999",
  "email": "akhil@example.com"
}
```

**Create an account**
```http
POST http://localhost:8080/accounts
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "accountType": "SAVINGS",
  "customerId": 1
}
```

**Transfer money**
```http
POST http://localhost:8080/transactions/transfer
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "fromAccount": "ACC1716234567890",
  "toAccount": "ACC1716234567999",
  "amount": 500
}
```

**Get transaction history**
```http
GET http://localhost:8080/transactions/account/ACC1716234567890
```
